        title: "Lesson 1: Stock Market Basics",
        content: "This lesson covers the fundamental concepts of how stock markets function as the backbone of modern economies.",
        notes: "Stock markets are platforms where buyers and sellers trade shares of publicly listed companies. They serve two primary functions: 1) Provide companies access to capital through public offerings, and 2) Provide investors with liquidity - the ability to quickly buy or sell their investments. The market operates on the principles of supply and demand - when more investors want to buy a stock than sell it, the price rises, and vice versa. Market participants include retail investors, institutional investors (like mutual funds and pension funds), market makers (who provide liquidity), and speculators. The stock market is often considered a leading economic indicator because stock prices tend to rise when the economy is expected to grow and fall when economic contraction is anticipated.",
        questions: [
          "What are the two primary functions of stock markets?",
          "How does supply and demand affect stock prices?",
          "Who are the main participants in stock markets?",
          "Why is the stock market considered an economic indicator?",
          "What is the difference between primary and secondary markets?"
        ],
        answers: [
          "The two primary functions are: 1) Providing companies access to capital through public offerings, and 2) Providing investors with liquidity to buy and sell investments.",
          "When demand (buyers) exceeds supply (sellers), prices rise. When supply exceeds demand, prices fall. This constant balancing act determines stock prices moment to moment.",
          "Main participants include retail investors, institutional investors (mutual funds, pension funds), market makers, speculators, and the companies themselves through IPOs and stock buybacks.",
          "Stock markets are forward-looking - prices reflect investors' collective expectations about future economic conditions. Rising markets often predict economic growth, while falling markets may predict downturns.",
          "The primary market is where companies first sell shares to the public (IPOs). The secondary market is where investors trade these shares among themselves on exchanges like NYSE or NASDAQ."

        title: "Lesson 2: Stock Exchanges and Trading Venues",
        content: "Learn about different types of stock exchanges and how they facilitate trading.",
        notes: "Major stock exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, London Stock Exchange (LSE), and Tokyo Stock Exchange. The NYSE is an auction-based market with a physical trading floor, while NASDAQ is entirely electronic. Exchanges provide: 1) Liquidity - ensuring buyers and sellers can easily trade, 2) Price discovery - establishing fair market prices through open trading, and 3) Transparency - making trade information publicly available. Alternative trading systems (ATS) like dark pools allow institutional investors to trade large blocks of shares anonymously to avoid market impact. Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) are digital systems that match buy and sell orders automatically. The Over-the-Counter (OTC) market trades stocks not listed on major exchanges, often smaller or riskier companies.",
        questions: [
          "What are the key differences between NYSE and NASDAQ?",
          "What three main functions do exchanges provide?",
          "Why do institutional investors sometimes use dark pools?",
          "How do Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) work?",
          "What types of stocks trade on OTC markets?"
        ],
        answers: [
          "NYSE has a physical trading floor and uses a hybrid auction/electronic system with designated market makers. NASDAQ is fully electronic with multiple market makers competing.",
          "Exchanges provide liquidity (easy trading), price discovery (fair pricing through open trading), and transparency (public trade information).",
          "Institutional investors use dark pools to trade large blocks of shares anonymously, preventing market impact that could move prices against them.",
          "ECNs are digital platforms that automatically match buy and sell orders without human intervention, often providing faster execution and lower costs.",
          "OTC markets trade stocks not listed on major exchanges, including small companies, foreign stocks, and companies that don't meet exchange listing requirements."

        title: "Lesson 3: Trading Mechanisms and Order Types",
        content: "Understand how trades are executed and the different types of orders you can place.",
        notes: "Market orders execute immediately at the current market price, while limit orders only execute at a specified price or better. Stop orders become market orders when a specified price is reached, used to limit losses (stop-loss) or protect profits. The bid price is what buyers are willing to pay, the ask price is what sellers want, with the difference called the bid-ask spread (a cost to traders). Market makers profit from this spread while providing liquidity. Trading happens in microseconds today, with high-frequency trading (HFT) firms using algorithms to exploit tiny price differences. Settlement (the actual exchange of money for shares) typically occurs two business days after the trade (T+2). After-hours trading allows trading outside normal market hours but with less liquidity and wider spreads.",

          "Market orders execute immediately at current prices, while limit orders only execute at a specified price or better, giving price control but no execution guarantee.",
          "A stop-loss automatically sells if the price falls to a specified level, limiting potential losses without requiring constant monitoring.",
          "The bid-ask spread is the difference between what buyers will pay (bid) and sellers will accept (ask). Market makers profit from this spread as compensation for providing liquidity.",
          "Technology enables microsecond executions, algorithmic trading, and electronic matching systems that have largely replaced human floor traders.",

      indicators: {
        title: "Lesson 4: Market Indicators and Indexes",
        content: "Learn how to interpret market indicators and what major indexes represent.",
        notes: "Market indexes track the performance of groups of stocks to represent the overall market or specific sectors. The S&P 500 tracks 500 large U.S. companies and is considered the best representation of the U.S. market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) tracks 30 large companies but is price-weighted (less representative). NASDAQ Composite focuses on technology stocks. Other important indexes include the Russell 2000 (small-cap stocks) and MSCI indices (international markets). Index funds and ETFs allow investors to buy entire indexes. Market indicators include: 1) Advance-decline line (shows market breadth), 2) VIX (measures expected volatility), 3) Trading volume (shows activity level), and 4) Moving averages (show trends). Understanding these helps investors gauge market health and sentiment.",

        answers: [
          "The S&P 500 includes 500 companies across all sectors weighted by market cap, while the DJIA only has 30 price-weighted stocks, making it less representative.",
          "The NASDAQ Composite emphasizes technology and growth-oriented companies, though it includes all stocks listed on NASDAQ.",
          "Index funds aim to replicate the performance of specific market indexes by holding all (or a representative sample) of the index's stocks in the same proportions.",
          "The VIX (Volatility Index) measures expected 30-day volatility in the S&P 500. A high VIX suggests fear and uncertainty, while a low VIX suggests complacency.",
          "Moving averages smooth price data to identify trends. Crossings of short-term and long-term averages can signal trend changes (e.g., 50-day crossing 200-day)."

        content: "Understand the regulatory framework that keeps markets fair and protects investors.",
        notes: "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the primary U.S. regulator enforcing securities laws to protect investors and maintain fair markets. Key regulations include: 1) Disclosure requirements (companies must provide accurate financial information), 2) Insider trading prohibitions (trading on non-public information is illegal), 3) Market manipulation rules (preventing artificial price movements), and 4) Broker-dealer oversight (ensuring proper conduct). The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regulates brokers. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) protects against broker failures (not market losses). Circuit breakers temporarily halt trading during extreme volatility to prevent panic selling. Recent regulations address high-frequency trading and dark pools. International markets have their own regulators like the FCA in the UK.",

          "The SEC enforces securities laws, ensures proper disclosure, prevents fraud, oversees securities professionals, and maintains fair, orderly, and efficient markets.",
          "Insider trading undermines market fairness by allowing those with non-public information to profit at the expense of other investors who lack that advantage.",
          "SIPC protects against broker failures (up to $500,000 per account), but doesn't protect against market losses or fraud by the companies themselves.",
          "Circuit breakers pause trading during extreme volatility to give investors time to assess information and prevent panic-driven market crashes.",
