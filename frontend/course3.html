        notes: "To start investing in stocks, you'll need: 1) A brokerage account (choose between full-service brokers, discount brokers, or robo-advisors), 2) Funds to invest (start with what you can afford), and 3) Basic knowledge of how markets work. Key decisions include: choosing between taxable accounts or retirement accounts (like IRAs), deciding between active or passive investing, and determining your investment style (growth, value, or income investing). Beginners should start with small amounts, diversify their holdings, and focus on long-term investing rather than short-term trading. Dollar-cost averaging (investing fixed amounts regularly) can help reduce market timing risks.",

          "What are the three main things you need to start investing in stocks?",

          "You need: 1) A brokerage account, 2) Funds to invest, and 3) Basic market knowledge.",
          "Taxable accounts have no special tax benefits but offer flexibility. Retirement accounts (like IRAs) offer tax advantages but have contribution limits and withdrawal restrictions.",
          "Main styles are: growth investing (focusing on companies expected to grow rapidly), value investing (looking for undervalued stocks), and income investing (focusing on dividend-paying stocks).",
          "Diversification spreads risk across different companies and sectors, reducing the impact if any single investment performs poorly.",
          "Dollar-cost averaging means investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high, smoothing out market volatility."

        notes: "Fundamental analysis examines a company's financial health and business prospects through: 1) Financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement), 2) Key ratios (P/E, P/B, debt-to-equity, ROE), 3) Industry position and competitive advantages, and 4) Management quality. Technical analysis studies price patterns and market trends using charts and indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD). Qualitative factors include: brand strength, industry trends, regulatory environment, and company culture. Quantitative factors include all measurable financial metrics. Research tools include: company filings (10-K, 10-Q), analyst reports, financial news, and stock screeners. Always consider both the company's current situation and its future growth potential.",

          "Why is it important to consider both qualitative and quantitative factors?"
        ],
        answers: [
          "Fundamental analysis includes examining financial statements, calculating key ratios, assessing industry position, and evaluating management quality.",
          "Fundamental analysis focuses on company financials and business prospects, while technical analysis studies price movements and market psychology through charts and indicators.",
          "Important ratios include: Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Book (P/B), Debt-to-Equity, Return on Equity (ROE), and Profit Margins.",
          "Investors can find financial information in company filings (10-K annual reports, 10-Q quarterly reports), investor relations websites, and financial data providers.",
          "Quantitative factors provide measurable data, while qualitative factors (like management quality and brand strength) can significantly impact long-term success but are harder to measure."

        notes: "Common investment strategies include: 1) Value investing (buying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals), 2) Growth investing (focusing on companies with above-average growth potential), 3) Dividend investing (selecting stocks with consistent dividend payments), 4) Index investing (buying broad market index funds), and 5) Momentum investing (following recent price trends). Long-term investors typically use buy-and-hold strategies, while active traders might use swing trading or day trading approaches. Sector rotation involves shifting investments among economic sectors based on macroeconomic cycles. The best strategy depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. Many successful investors combine multiple strategies or adjust their approach as market conditions change.",

        notes: "Portfolio construction involves: 1) Asset allocation (dividing investments among different asset classes), 2) Diversification (spreading investments across sectors/industries), and 3) Rebalancing (periodically adjusting to maintain target allocations). A well-diversified portfolio typically includes stocks from different sectors (technology, healthcare, finance, etc.), market caps (large, mid, small), and geographic regions. The 60/40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is a classic balanced approach. Younger investors can typically take more risk (higher stock allocation), while those nearing retirement may want more bonds. Core-satellite investing combines a stable core (index funds) with smaller satellite positions (individual stocks). Regular portfolio reviews (quarterly or annually) help maintain alignment with your goals.",

Risk management strategies include: diversification, position sizing (limiting exposure to any single stock), stop-loss orders, hedging (using options or inverse ETFs), and maintaining cash reserves. The risk-reward tradeoff means higher potential returns typically require accepting higher risk. Understanding your personal risk tolerance is crucial - don't take risks that will keep you awake at night.

        notes: "Behavioral finance studies how psychology influences investors and markets. Common biases include: 1) Overconfidence (overestimating knowledge/skills), 2) Confirmation bias (seeking information that supports existing views), 3) Loss aversion (feeling losses more acutely than gains), 4) Herd mentality (following the crowd), and 5) Anchoring (fixating on specific price points). Emotional investing often leads to buying high (during excitement) and selling low (during fear). Successful investors develop rules-based systems to counter emotional impulses. Maintaining an investment journal can help identify personal bias patterns. Understanding market cycles helps recognize when emotions might be driving prices to extremes. The most successful investors often go against the crowd when fundamentals justify doing so.",
